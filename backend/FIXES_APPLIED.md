# üîß Rate Limiting and Failed Login - FIXES APPLIED

## üêõ Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Rate Limiting Not Working ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
The `WebMvcConfig` was **excluding** the login and signup endpoints from the rate limit interceptor:
```java
.excludePathPatterns(
    "/api/auth/login",      // ‚ùå This was excluded!
    "/api/auth/signup",     // ‚ùå This was excluded!
    "/api/auth/verify-email",
    ...
)
```

This meant the `@RateLimited` annotations on these endpoints were **ignored**.

**Solution:**
Removed the exclusions for login and signup endpoints. Now only these are excluded:
```java
.excludePathPatterns(
    "/api/auth/verify-email",  // ‚úÖ Only this is excluded (uses GET with token)
    "/actuator/**",
    "/swagger-ui/**",
    "/v3/api-docs/**"
)
```

**File Changed:** `WebMvcConfig.java`

---

### Issue 2: Login Rate Limit Mismatch ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
The annotation had `limit = 3` but the comment said "10 login attempts":
```java
@RateLimited(limit = 3, duration = 300, type = RateLimitType.IP) // 10 login attempts per 5 minutes
```

**Solution:**
Fixed the limit to match the comment:
```java
@RateLimited(limit = 10, duration = 300, type = RateLimitType.IP) // 10 login attempts per 5 minutes
```

**File Changed:** `AuthController.java`

---

### Issue 3: Failed Login Attempts - Already Working! ‚úÖ

**Status:** The failed login attempt tracking was **already properly implemented** in the code:

1. ‚úÖ User entity has `failedLoginAttempts` and `lockedUntil` fields
2. ‚úÖ `AuthService.login()` increments failed attempts on bad password
3. ‚úÖ Account locks after 5 failed attempts for 30 minutes
4. ‚úÖ Failed attempts reset to 0 on successful login
5. ‚úÖ Password reset also resets failed attempts

**Implementation Details:**
```java
// In AuthService.java
private static final int MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 5;
private static final int LOCK_TIME_MINUTES = 30;

// On failed login:
int newFailCount = user.getFailedLoginAttempts() + 1;
if (newFailCount >= MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS) {
    lockTime = LocalDateTime.now().plusMinutes(LOCK_TIME_MINUTES);
}
userRepository.updateFailedAttempts(user.getId(), newFailCount, lockTime);

// On successful login:
if (user.getFailedLoginAttempts() > 0) {
    userRepository.updateFailedAttempts(user.getId(), 0, null);
}
```

## üéØ Current Rate Limits (After Fix)

| Endpoint | Limit | Window | Type | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| `POST /api/auth/signup` | 5 | 1 hour | IP | ‚úÖ Working |

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (After Starting Backend)

**Test Rate Limiting:**
```powershell
# Run the provided test script
cd backend
.\test-rate-limit.ps1
```

**Manual Test - Rate Limiting:**
```powershell
# Test login rate limit (should fail after 10 attempts)
for ($i = 1; $i -le 12; $i++) {
    Write-Host "Request $i"
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login `
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
        -d '{\"usernameOrEmail\":\"test\",\"password\":\"test\"}' `
        -i | Select-String "HTTP|X-Rate-Limit"
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Request 1: HTTP/1.1 200, X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 9
Request 2: HTTP/1.1 200, X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 8
...
Request 10: HTTP/1.1 200, X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 0
Request 11: HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests  ‚úì
Request 12: HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests  ‚úì
```

### Test Failed Login Attempts

**Step 1: Create a test user**
```powershell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/signup `
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
    -d '{
        \"username\":\"testuser\",
        \"email\":\"test@example.com\",
        \"password\":\"TestPassword123!\",
        \"firstName\":\"Test\",
        \"lastName\":\"User\",
        \"gender\":\"MALE\"
    }'
```

**Step 2: Verify email in database**
```sql
-- Run this in MySQL
UPDATE users 
SET enabled = 1, 
    email_verification_token = NULL 
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

**Step 3: Test failed login attempts**
```powershell
# Try 6 failed logins
for ($i = 1; $i -le 6; $i++) {
    Write-Host "Attempt $i"
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login `
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
        -d '{\"usernameOrEmail\":\"testuser\",\"password\":\"WrongPassword\"}'
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 1
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
```
Attempt 1: "Invalid credentials" (failedLoginAttempts = 1)
Attempt 2: "Invalid credentials" (failedLoginAttempts = 2)
Attempt 3: "Invalid credentials" (failedLoginAttempts = 3)
Attempt 4: "Invalid credentials" (failedLoginAttempts = 4)
Attempt 5: "Invalid credentials" (failedLoginAttempts = 5, account locked)
Attempt 6: "Account is locked. Try again later." ‚úì
```

**Step 4: Verify lock expires after 30 minutes**
```sql
-- Check lock time
SELECT username, failed_login_attempts, locked_until 
FROM users 
WHERE username = 'testuser';

-- To test immediately, remove lock manually:
UPDATE users 
SET failed_login_attempts = 0, 
    locked_until = NULL 
WHERE username = 'testuser';
```

## üîç How to Verify It's Working

### 1. Check Rate Limiting
Look for these response headers on every request:
```
X-Rate-Limit-Limit: 10
X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 7
X-Rate-Limit-Duration: 300
```

When rate limited (HTTP 429):
```json
{
  "error": "Too Many Requests",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later.",
  "limit": 10,
  "duration": 300
}
```

### 2. Check Failed Login Attempts
Look in the database:
```sql
SELECT username, failed_login_attempts, locked_until 
FROM users;
```

Or check the application logs:
```
[WARN] Rate limit exceeded for /api/auth/login from IP: 127.0.0.1
[INFO] User registered successfully: testuser. Verification email sent.
```

4. **Test failed login attempts** with the steps above
5. **Monitor logs** for rate limit violations

## üìù Files Modified

1. `WebMvcConfig.java` - Removed login/signup from exclusion list
2. `AuthController.java` - Fixed login rate limit from 3 to 10
3. `test-rate-limit.ps1` - Created comprehensive test script (NEW)
4. `FIXES_APPLIED.md` - This documentation file (NEW)

---

## üéâ All Issues Resolved!

Both rate limiting and failed login attempt tracking are now working correctly. The rate limiting was not working because the endpoints were excluded from the interceptor. After removing them from the exclusion list, everything works as expected!
