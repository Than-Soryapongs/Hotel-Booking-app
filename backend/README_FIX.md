# 🔥 QUICK FIX SUMMARY

## What Was Wrong?
```
WebMvcConfig was EXCLUDING login and signup from rate limiting!
```

## The Fix
```diff
  .excludePathPatterns(
-     "/api/auth/login",      ❌ REMOVED
-     "/api/auth/signup",     ❌ REMOVED
      "/api/auth/verify-email",
      "/actuator/**",
      ...
  )
```

## Test It Now!
```powershell
# 1. Restart backend
# 2. Run this:
cd backend
.\quick-test.ps1

# Expected: First 10 OK, then RATE LIMITED ✓
```

## Files Changed
1. ✅ `WebMvcConfig.java` - Removed login/signup exclusions
2. ✅ `AuthController.java` - Fixed rate limit 3→10

## Status: READY TO TEST 🚀
